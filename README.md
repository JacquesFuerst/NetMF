# NetMF

in this preoject, I tried to reproduce the results of the study 'A Comparative Study for Unsupervised Network
Representation Learning' by Cosla, Setty, and Anand (2019). I focused on the NetMF method and used some datasets from the study, and some of my own. 

The repository mainly contains the code for creating the NetMF embedding, and code for node classification and link predicition. On top of that, it contains the relevant datasets I used and the embeddings I created. All of this was executed in Google colab, which explains the structure of the jupyter notebooks.
